# Foundation in Truth  
_The Seven Pillars of Lawful Remedy_

> _“Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.”_  
> — Proverbs 9:1

This Assembly and all works published herein rest upon seven foundational truths. These are not beliefs or theories — they are observable, self-evident principles upon which all lawful standing, remedy, and peace are built.

### ⚖️ 1. Truth of Creation
Every soul is born of the living. No corporation, government, or code can supersede the origin of life itself. Man and woman are not products of the state, but witnesses of the creation. We do not operate by permission — we stand by inheritance.

> _“No law can give what nature has denied.”_ — Roman Maxim of Law

---

### 📜 2. Truth of Trust
All modern systems are built on trusts — split titles, assumed obligations, and hidden beneficiary roles. Once this is known, it is lawful to reclaim the role of executor, heir, and living trustee of one's life and labor. If you do not act in trust, another will act over you by presumption.

> _“Let him who would not be deceived learn first how the world was deceived.”_

### 🪪 3. Truth of Standing
Only the living have standing. Legal entities, dead names, and artificial persons may be governed, taxed, or detained — but the living man or woman cannot be owned. When standing is established, remedy becomes possible. When it is not, remedy is presumed waived.

> _“He who does not assert his rights has none.”_  
> — United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875)

### 🌍 4. Truth of Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction means “the right to speak law.” Without consent, no authority may claim jurisdiction over the living. All contracts must be entered knowingly, willingly, and intentionally. Silence is not consent when remedy is hidden.

> _“A slave is one who waits for someone to come and free him.”_ — Ezra Pound

---

### 🕊️ 5. Truth of Remedy
No lawful system can deny remedy. Even in the most corrupt codes, remedy is preserved — quietly, subtly, lawfully. To ignore this is to remain bound. To act upon it is to be free. This site exists as a witness that remedy is real and claimable.

> _“Ignorance of the law excuses no one; ignorance of fact may.”_

---

### 🗂️ 6. Truth of Record
That which is not recorded is presumed waived. Public record creates lawful notice and rebuts presumption. Every document published here serves as lawful evidence of correction, truth, and non-consent to the commercial fiction.

> _“What is not on the record, does not exist in law.”_

---

### ✌️ 7. Truth of Peace
True remedy comes not through war or protest, but peace. We do not argue with falsehood — we correct the record, give notice, and walk away. Let it be known: this is a peaceful claim, made in honor, with no ill will toward any.

> _“Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”_  
> — Matthew 10:16

### 🕯️ Final Word
These truths form the lawful and spiritual foundation of this Assembly. All declarations, notices, trusts, and teaching materials published on this site are built upon these pillars. They are not secret. They are not new. They are simply remembered.

> _“Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again.”_ — William Cullen Bryant
